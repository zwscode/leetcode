"""
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
Example 2:

Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 45
"""
# Idea: state transition equation: dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
# Why? We only need to consider 2 situations. Situation1: we climb 1 step from i-1. Situation2: we climb 2 steps from i-2. And in Situation2, if we climb 1 step, we will be in Situation1. So total steps is dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2].
