```python
'''
Given a string and a set of characters, return the **smallest** substring that contains all of the characters in the set
'''

def solution(string, char_set):
	# Step 1 and 2
	left, right, best_score = 0, 0, float('inf')

	# Step 3a:  Generally, for sliding window, you often need a set or hashmap to track
	#           the characters/values you have in your substring/subarray
	# Step 3b: This is an auxiliary value that lets us cleanly look up the characters
	#          in char_set that we have found
	letter_map = {} # maps from character to number of occurences in the substring
	characters_encountered = 0 # when this is equal to len(char_set), we have a
							   # candidate substring
	# Step 4
	while right < len(string):
		curr_right = string[right]

		# Step 5
		if curr_right in char_set:
			letter_map[curr_right] = letter_map.get(curr_right, 0) + 1
			if letter_map[curr_right] == 1:
				characters_encountered += 1
		right += 1

		# Step 6: If you have a new candidate substring (in this case we found all
		# our letters, begin incrementing left until it is *invalid*
		if (characters_encountered == len(char_set)):
			while characters_encountered == len(char_set):
				curr_left = string[left]
				if curr_left in char_set:
					letter_map[curr_left] -= 1
					if letter_map[curr_left] == 0:
						characters_encountered -= 1
				left += 1
			# Step 7: Finally! Update the best score if we have a new best.
			#    This new candidate substring is bounded by right - left + 1. Avoid
			#    off-by-one's by drawing an example out.
			best_score = min(best_score, right - left + 1)
	return best_score
